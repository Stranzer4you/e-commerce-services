# ðŸ“¦ Kafka Integration â€” E-Commerce Modular Monolith

This project simulates a **Kafka-integrated modular monolith** for an e-commerce system. The main focus is not on building a complete shopping platform, but to **learn and implement Apache Kafka in a real-world, service-oriented architecture using Spring Boot.**

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose of the Project

> ðŸ§  This is a **learning-focused architecture project**, not a production-level e-commerce app.

- âœ… Understand **Kafka producer/consumer internals**
- âœ… Explore **inter-service communication** using **Kafka topics**
- âœ… Implement **event-driven** message flows
- âœ… Preserve **message ordering** using key-based partitioning
- âœ… Practice **modular monolithic service segregation**
- âœ… Reduce coupling between services through Kafka decoupling

---

## ðŸš€ Objective

- Enable **service-to-service** communication using **Kafka topics**
- Ensure **ordered processing** for each `orderId` using **key-based partitioning**
- Trigger **notifications**, update **order status**, and initiate **inventory/shipping** asynchronously
- Improve **scalability** and **fault tolerance**

## ðŸ§© Services in the Architecture

| Service         | Responsibility                          |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------|
| Order Service   | Creates/updates orders and status        |
| Payment Service | Handles payment lifecycle                |
| Inventory       | Updates and manages stock                |
| Shipping        | Triggers and updates delivery            |
| Notification    | Sends push, SMS, and email notifications |

## ðŸ”„ Kafka Event Flow (Simplified)

```text
[Order Service]
   â””â”€â”€ orders.created
   â””â”€â”€ order.payment.initiated
   â—„â”€â”€ payment.success / failed / pending
   â””â”€â”€ order.status.updated

[Payment Service]
   â—„â”€â”€ order.payment.initiated
   â””â”€â”€ payment.success / failed / pending
   â””â”€â”€ inventory.update
   â””â”€â”€ shipping.initiate

[Shipping Service]
   â—„â”€â”€ shipping.initiate
   â””â”€â”€ shipping.status

[Notification Service]
   â—„â”€â”€ orders.created
   â—„â”€â”€ order.status.updated
   â—„â”€â”€ payment.*
   â—„â”€â”€ shipping.status
   
```

## ðŸ§© Kafka Integration Per Service

### âœ… **Order Service**
- **Produces:**
    - `ecommerce.orders.created`
    - `ecommerce.order.payment.initiated`
    - `ecommerce.order.status.updated`
- **Consumes:**
    - `ecommerce.payment.success`
    - `ecommerce.payment.failed`
    - `ecommerce.payment.pending`
- **Responsibility:**
    - Manages order lifecycle and status
    - Updates DB and sends notifications on payment updates

---

### âœ… **Payment Service**
- **Consumes:**
    - `ecommerce.order.payment.initiated`
- **Produces:**
    - `ecommerce.payment.success`
    - `ecommerce.payment.failed`
    - `ecommerce.payment.pending`
    - `ecommerce.inventory.update`
    - `ecommerce.shipping.initiate`

## ðŸ§  Design Decisions

- All events related to an entity (`orderId`) are produced with that ID as the **Kafka message key**, ensuring **partition-based ordering**.
- Each topic has **3 partitions** and listener concurrency is set to 3 for parallelism.
- Every service uses a dedicated **consumer group** to consume messages.
- Messages are sent using **POJOs** and serialized with `JsonSerializer`.
